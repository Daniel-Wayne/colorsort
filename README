CSE Colorsort Robot

This is a project within the Computer Science & Engineering
Club at CSUSB. The initial goal of this project is to program
a pre-assembled robot to match object colors by placing colored
objects into the proper bin.

Individuals of our group may meet up independently or with other
group members to work on the robot.

CSE Club office hours are found on the club website: cse-club.com

Members who wish to contribute to the code may fork this
repository and submit a pull request after commiting their code.

I will place files in here with empty function definitions in hopes
that somebody will fill in the function implementations.
